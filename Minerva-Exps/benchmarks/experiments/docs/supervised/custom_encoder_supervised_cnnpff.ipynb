    "# Supervised Training a Custom Encoder on the DAGHAR Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will train a custom encoder from scratch on the DAGHAR KuHAR dataset. The encoder can be **any** `torch.nn.Module` \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we will first define your model by:\n",
    "1. Define the encoder. We going to call this encoder as `backbone`.\n",
    "2. Calculating the embedding size of the `backbone`. This is necessary to define the head of the model. This is done by passing a dummy input through the `backbone` and checking the output shape.\n",
    "3. Defining the head of the model. We use a standard MLP classifier as the head, whose input size is the embedding size, followed by a hidden layer of 128 units and an output layer with the number of classes in the dataset, that is, 6.\n",
    "4. Creating a `SimpleSupervisedModel` with the `backbone` and the head. The `SimpleSupervisedModel` is a PyTorch Lightning module that receives the `backbone` and the head as arguments and trains the model end-to-end. This model simply forwards the input through the `backbone`, flattens the output, and passes it through the head to get the logits, whose loss is calculated using the cross-entropy loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, for sake of reproducibility, you should only change parts related to loading the encoder and defining the head of the model. The rest of the code should remain the same (or at least very similar) to the one provided in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:**\n",
    "1. The `backbone` should have a `forward` method that takes a batch of time series as input and returns the output of the encoder (embeddings). Your encoder must accept samples with the shape `(batch_size, channels, steps)`, where `channels` is the number of channels in the time series and `steps` is the number of time steps. For DAGHAR dataset, `channels=6` and `steps=60`. **Thus, your encoder should accept samples with the shape `(batch_size, 6, 60)`.**\n",
